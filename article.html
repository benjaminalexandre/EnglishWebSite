Its situated on the Zambeze river, at the frontier between Zambia and Zimbabwe. This waterfalls throw them in on long fault of more than 1 700m long and 100m height, and escape in a narrow canyon.
The original name is ''Mosi-oa-Tunya'' translated by ''the smoke which rumble''. If you are in Zimbabwe, you will see the waterfall in front of you but if you're in Zambia, you will be feet in the water. The show is extraordinary!" href="assets/img/portfolio/big/12.webp">VIEW ARTICLE</a>
